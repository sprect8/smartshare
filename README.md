# smartshare
A 0.4.x smart share solidity contract to split ether across multiple users.

The purpose of Smart Share is to automate the distribution of funds from a shared mining account into the accounts of multiple people

A team of guys have purchased a mining rig to mine ethereum. The total mined assets are pushed into a shared account.
The mined assets are then split each month on maturity of the mining contract for the month. Each person gets a share of the mined assets depending on their share of the mining rig
